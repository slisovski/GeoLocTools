# Tools for light level geolocation

GeoLocTools provides tools for the analysis of geolocator data that can be used in combination with most analysis tools like _GeoLight_, _SGAT_, _FLightR_ etc.

It is also developed to facilitate geolocator workshops by making sure that all nessesary packages as well as additional tools and descriptions (see vignette) are available and running for all participants.

 Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package. 

```R
devtools::install_github("SLisovski/GeoLocTools")
```

If you don't have `devtools` installed already, install it first. 

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

GeoLocTools otherwise does not need devtools for normal use.)
